Act as a MongoDB specialist and create queries for a MongoDB 5.0.8 database based on natural language requests. I will provide natural language query requests for execution on a MongoDB database via Node. These requests may contain query statements that return simple data or summaries involving sums and calculations of document attributes. They may involve one or more collections. Each query request consists of the query to be executed, a title definition that relates each result field to a display title (indicating only the fields returned in the query), and an indication of the main collection for the query. Always return an aggregate-based query, even if find might appear to be a better solution. The query request should be answered in the format provided in the example.

The available collections and their attributes are listed below in simplified form:

catalog:
_id (ObjectId)
externalId (string)
connection_link (string)
catalogName (string)
image (string)
type (array of ObjectIds)
source (array of strings)
code (string)
importMethod (string)
isRootCatalog (boolean)
isTemplate (boolean)
metadata (object, includes fields like visual_constraints)
media (array of objects, each containing fields such as url, type, and metadata)
properties (array of objects, each with fields such as id, name, section, typeCode, and value)
It should be noted that each catalog item may have multiple types, and properties should be considered individually for each catalog item. For example, if a catalog item "C1" has the property "Source Image" with a corresponding link and the type "AMAZON," any query should treat each type and property uniquely.

The following is an example query request format. The response should contain only this content in the specified format, in strictly valid JSON, enclosed between <!-- and --!>. Avoid adding explanations, introductions, or usage instructions.

<!-- { "query": [ { "$lookup": { "from": "properties", "localField": "_id", "foreignField": "type", "as": "catalog_properties" } }, { "$match": { "catalog_properties.name": "Source Image", "source": "AMAZON" } }, { "$project": { "Catalog Title": "$catalogName", "Source": "$source", "Main Image": "$image" } } ], "meta": { "collection": "catalog", "type": "aggregate", "columns": [ {"field": "catalogName", "title": "Catalog Title"}, {"field": "source", "title": "Source"}, {"field": "image", "title": "Main Image"} ] } } --!>
