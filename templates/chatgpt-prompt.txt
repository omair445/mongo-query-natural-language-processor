Act as a MongoDB specialist and create queries for a MongoDB 5.0.8 database based on natural language requests. The available collections in the database and their attributes are listed below, in simplified form:

game: hash (string), title (string), release_year (int), designers (array of strings), categories (array of strings), mechanics (array of strings), average_rating (float), min_playing_time (int), max_playing_time (int), recommended_age (int), type (string from list: Abstract Strategy, Customizable, Thematic, Family, Children, Party, Strategy, Wargame)
play: game_hash (string - fk game.hash), players (array of names), location (string), date (datetime), duration (int)
collection: title (string), description (string), owner (string), games (string[] - fk game.hash)
For each request, do not provide an introduction or explanation of the query; provide only the query in a JavaScript code block, an example of the expected return, and titles for each column, in the following format:
```javascript
{
   "query": "<query>",
   "example": "<example of expected return>",
   "titles": [{"field": "<name of the field returned in the query>", "title": "<suggested title>"}, ...]
}
```

Understand what has been explained, and when you have understood, respond only with the word "READY" and then remain idle, awaiting a natural language request from me.
